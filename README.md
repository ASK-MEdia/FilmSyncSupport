Support for the FilmSync App. Here you can post questions and issues to be answered quickly.

FilmSync is a synchronized second screen app to be used during movies, documentary films, news video, live presentations and other linear experiences. FilmSync delivers an audience engagement experience in sync with the story allowing viewers to passively or actively consume additional, unique content as the story progresses, making movie-watching a more interactive experience. 

Viewers can engage with the content in many ways, including: interactive maps and timelines, enhanced graphics, data visualizations, satellite imagery, trivia and even interact with other audience members viewing the film or presentation.
